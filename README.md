# Project_01_Game
Simon Says//”Lilly Says”
-   like the idea of testing someone’s memory
-   could be used for alternate purposes other than just playing a game
o   maybe testing a concussion 
o   general tiredness/alertness level

Wireframes
-   Instructions Page
o   List out the instructions in clear text 
-   Game Page
o   create start button to set off the game
o   keep score, every time the user gets a pattern right, store in correspondence to their name 
o   if you get a pattern correct you get  X points  
o   set up 4 objects that each have an event // array position associated with them to store into specific patterns 
o   have the patterns increasingly get faster and longer when the user gets the pattern correct
o   store each , if users input is === lilly’s array then continue if != trigger game overa
-   Score Page
o   Store high scores into list format to show previous players highscore, only keep the last 3
o   Have it linked from information on Game Page 

Game Structure
-   have 12 elements in an array if the div lights up then store that into the first position in the array, then so on and so forth 
-   set the max score to X if the user reaches that score then they beat the game 
-   each square will light up once through its pattern then the user will have to take a turn, and complete the same pattern, if correct another pattern will play faster and one light longer if correct continue with the same method increasing time and length if incorrect, game over 
-   store the highscore until the user reloads the page

Potential Challenges to Encounter
-   How the pattern generator is going to function- Is there a way to randomize how the patterns light up and say if the array that is generated by a randomizer === to the array entered by the user, continue on 
o   How to get the same object at position [0] to then turn into [4]
-   VISUALLY APPEALING
o   I have trouble positioning elements on a page, review how margin and padding work between images/text and the web page
-   How to get the game to stop, reload and store the user’s past score if they keep playing on the same page 

Phases of Completion 
-   Step 1: Create baseline HTML//CSS outline for the instructions page, game page and score page (1 day)
o   Create content for the instructions // how to play
o   Create shell of the game board 
o   Create the highscore page as a list that displays the information 
o   Link them all together with buttons at the bottom of each page
-   Step 2: Work through the Javascript (2 days)
o   Set up the boxes lighting up and increasing in speed after each turn
o   Array length set to 12, all items are initially empty, if it lights then the divs value is pushed into the corresponding position in the array if the user can then match this same array on their turn then they can continue
-   Step 3: CSS (1 day)
o   Find original imagery, pick out a visually consistent color base for each page as well as font
o   Position elements in relation to their text
o   Set the same background for each page 
-   Step 4: Make webpages responsive (.5 days)
o   Add user compatibility functions like saving the highscore, allowing them to enter their name and have it appear on all three pages
